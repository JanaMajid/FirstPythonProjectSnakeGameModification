Hello, this is my first Python project at university. I modified the classic Snake game; the new game has a few different features:

1. It has more appealing graphics and looks.
2. It has two levels; the snake must eat all the diamonds (which score 5 points and add 5 body parts) and apples (which score 1 point and add one body part) in level one to advance to level two.
3. In level two, the snake must be aware of the poisoned apple and the sniper.
